FOR THE DATABASE TO WORK
download the sql file within the database code folder and import it into an instance of phpmyadmin
this will give the user an instance of the database as it was when the project was complete
you will have to edit the server connection scripts to whatever the servername and serverpassword is on your instance of XAMPP
however, as you are importing the database the name of that should be fine

Figma will be required to run the design files
